# Windows Calculator

This is a simple calculator application built with Python's Tkinter library. It provides a graphical interface similar to classic Windows calculators. The program supports basic arithmetic operations and includes clear and backspace functionality.

## Usage

Run the following command in a Python environment (Python 3.7 or above is recommended):

```bash
python calculator.py
```

The calculator window will appear. Use the buttons to enter numbers and operations. Press `=` to evaluate the expression. Click `C` to clear the current expression or `⌫` to delete the last character.
